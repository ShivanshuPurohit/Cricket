# Cricket
Simulate cricket games from data scraped from espncricinfo.
(WIP)
### Running the code:
Beautiful Soup is required to scrape data. Install with `pip install beautifulsoup4`
To run the code, run `python custom.py` and follow the commands.
### Todo:
Debug scraping files to see why only a small number of players are added in ODI data.
